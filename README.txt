Hello Professor and Grader,

In this assignment, you can use W A S D to move around. 
You need to pick up keycards to open doors and reach the restart point to finish the game(It will reload the scene).
I didn't use any assets store. The character's 3D model is from my 170 Group, and I made my own animator to create the animated character. 
Animations are from Mixamo.com.

Thank you so much!
