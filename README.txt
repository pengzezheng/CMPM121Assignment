Hello Professor and Grader,

In this assignment, you can use W A S D to move around. 
You need to pick up keycards to open doors and reach the restart point to finish the game(It will reload the scene).
The character's 3D model is from my 170 project, and I made my own animator to create the animated character. 
Animations of doors and keycards are made by myself. 
Only the animations of the character are from Mixamo.com. Link: https://www.mixamo.com/#/
The particle effect is from asset store. Link: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/fire-explosions/fx-explosion-pack-30102

Thank you so much!
